# LinkedIn Post - Irish Tax Simpler

## Post Content

🏗️ Just launched **Irish Tax Simpler** - an AI-powered RAG system that helps people understand Irish tax regulations! 🇮🇪

**What it does:**
✅ Answers tax questions with accurate, citation-backed responses
✅ Uses vector search (BGE embeddings) + reranking (Cohere) + AI generation (Perplexity Sonar)
✅ Response time: 2-3 seconds
✅ Beautiful Gradio web interface

**Tech Stack:**
- Python + Gradio for UI
- Qdrant for vector database
- Cohere for intelligent reranking
- Perplexity Sonar Pro for grounded answers
- Automatic source citations

**Built with:**
- RAG architecture (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Multi-stage pipeline: Retrieve → Rerank → Generate
- Optimized for speed and accuracy

Ask questions like "What is PAYE?", "How does PRSI work?", or "What are USC charges?" and get instant, reliable answers with full source citations! 📚

## Technical Achievement Version

🎯 **Project Deep Dive: Irish Tax Simpler**

Just built an end-to-end RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for Irish tax information.

**Architecture:**
1. **Retrieval**: Qdrant + BGE-large-en-v1.5 embeddings
2. **Reranking**: Cohere cross-encoder (rerank-english-v3.0)
3. **Generation**: Perplexity Sonar Pro with citation tracking

**Key Features:**
- Vector similarity search
- Query refinement and spell correction
- Automatic source citation with page numbers
- Response time: 2-3s (optimized)
- Gradio web interface

**Performance Metrics:**
- Retrieval: 10 docs in ~500ms
- Reranking: 3 docs in ~300ms
- Generation: ~1.8s
- Total: <3 seconds

Built with Python, deployed on Hugging Face Spaces!
